# Things I learned

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is hiding or bundling code into a single unit, so that only only certain things have access to that code instead of the entire program.
One way to implement encapsulation is by using Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)

## Factory Functions

Instead of using classes, we can create objects using factory functions

## Typescript

You can easily typecast in Typescript by using the as keyword. Type casting allows you to explicitly change the datatype of a variable.
